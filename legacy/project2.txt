The login for part 2 of my blog project works in a similar way. The user is prompted to login and the information given is compared to the users in the database. If the username and password given by the user match a username and password in the database the, the user is redirected to the homepage and the user session variable is set to 1, so that the user can only access the homepage if they are logged in. The posts are displayed on the homepage and the user has the option to toggle the comments on the posts or to make a comment on a specific post. To make a comment on a specific post, a text box and a submit button will be toggled. I have included ajax functionality into the contact form.If there were a third part of the class project, I would like to include APIs so that my website would be able to interact with other websites. I would also incorporate JavaScript that gives posts some type movement upon loading the page. Between part two and three of the project I learned how to incorporate more jQuery and AJAX. By doing this, my webpage does not require hard reloads when posting and commenting. I liked this project because it gave me a good overview when studying for the exam of what was taught throughout the course.
